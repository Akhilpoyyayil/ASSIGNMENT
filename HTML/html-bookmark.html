	<h1><a name="COMPUTER">COMPUTER</a></h1>
	<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
	<p>A computer is a device that accepts information (in the form of digitalized data) and manipulates it for some result based on a program or sequence of instructions on how the data is to be processed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
	<h3><a name="CPU">CPU</a></h3>
	<p>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="section">
	<h3><a name="ALU">ALU</a></h3>
	<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs</p>
</div>
 <div class="mainhead">
	<h1><a name="PL">PROGRAMING LANGUAGE</a></h1>
	<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
	<p>A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
	<h3><a name="c">C</a></h3>
	<p>C is a computer programming language. That means that you can use C to create lists of instructions for a computer to follow. C is one of thousands of programming languages currently in use.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="section">
	<h3><a name="c++">C++</a></h3>
	<p>C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.</p>

	<h1><a name="DBMS">DBMS</a></h1>
	<a href="#top">Go to top</a>
	<p>A database management system (DBMS) is a computer software application that interacts with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
	<h3><a name="RDBMS">RDBMS</a></h3>
	<p>RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.</p>
	</div>
 
<div class="section">
	<h3><a name="OODBMS">OODBMS</a></h3>
	<p>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="section">
	<h3><a name="HDDBMS"> HDDBMS</a></h3>
	<p>A heterogeneous database system is an automated (or semi-automated) system for the integration of heterogeneous, disparate database management systems to present a user with a single, unified query interface.
A Heterogeneous database system is like a democracy for the people by different kinds of people.
It is a database management system which intigrates various databases of different makes to work together as a single seamless application with the help of communication agents to translate info between the databases.</p>
