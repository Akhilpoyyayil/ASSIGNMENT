	<p style="color: blue">
	A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, 
	particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a 
	machine or to express algorithms.

	<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u> java</u></h1>
	<p style="color: blue">
	Java is an object-oriented language similar to C++, but simplified to eliminate language features that cause 
	common programming errors. Java source code files (files with a .java extension) are compiled into a format
	 called bytecode (files with a .class extension), which can then be executed by a Java interpreter

	<p style="color: blue">
	Oxygen is one of the most essential requirements of life, without which organisms on Earth would not survive. 
	Living organisms generate energy from food through the process of respiration. This allows humans and other 
	organisms to perform their daily tasks.
